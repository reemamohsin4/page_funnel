These files document the actions of users on an online store. The actions are as follow (in order): 
	1. page visit
	2. item added to cart
	3. item checked out
	4. item purchased
Four different csv files contain the data for each user who completed an action. This project analyzes trends in the stages of the shopping process by creating a funnel to determine which people continue on to each step.
